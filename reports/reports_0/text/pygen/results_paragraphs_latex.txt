In the study period there were 1,485,889 hospitalizations for 708,094 unique patients, 439,698 (62\%) of whom had only one hospitalization recorded. The median number of hospitalizations per patient was 1 (range 1-176, [1.0 , 2.0]). There were 211,022 thirty-day readmissions for an overall readmission rate of 14\%. Among patients aged 65 years or older, the thirty-day readmission rate was 16\%. The median length of stay was 2.94 days (range 0-628, [1.67 , 5.34]). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient cohort are summarized in Table 1. Higher rates of 30-day readmissions were observed in patients who were older (median age 62 vs. 59 years), black (rate of 17\% vs. 13\% in whites), divorced/separated or widowed (rates of 17\% vs. rates of 13\% for married/partnered or single patients), on Medicare insurance (rate of 17\% vs. 10\% for private insurance), and had conditions such as cancer, renal disease, congestive heart failure, and COPD (\hyperref[table:table1]{Table 1}).
