The cohort of hospitalizations was split into three groups for analysis: 80% for model development (n=1,182,963), 10% for testing (n=147,871), and 10% for validation (n=147,871). Selection of hospitalizations for inclusion in each group was random with the exception of ensuring the readmission rate was consistently 14%.
