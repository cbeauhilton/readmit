The cohort of hospitalizations was split into three groups for analysis: {len(train_set) / len(data) *100 :.0f}\% for model development, 10\% for testing, and 10\% for validation. For example, the 30--day readmission cohort had development, testing, and validation cohorts of n=239,999, n=30,001, and n=30,000, respectively. Selection of hospitalizations for inclusion in each group was random with the exception of ensuring the rate of the positive class (30-day readmission, length of stay over 5 days, etc.) was consistent between sets.
