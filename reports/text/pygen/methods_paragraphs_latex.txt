The cohort of hospitalizations was split into three groups for analysis: 80\% for model development, 10\% for testing, and 10\% for validation. For example, the 30--day readmission cohort had development, testing, and validation cohorts of n=1,168,519, n=146,066, and n=146,066, respectively. Selection of hospitalizations for inclusion in each group was random with the exception of ensuring the rate of the positive class (30-day readmission, length of stay over 5 days, etc.) was consistent between sets.
