In the study period there were 1,485,880 hospitalizations for 708,089 unique patients, 439,696 (62%) of whom had only one hospitalization recorded. The median number of hospitalizations per patient was 1 (range 1-176, [1.0 , 2.0]). There were 211,022 thirty-day readmissions for an overall readmission rate of 14%. Among patients aged 65 years or older, the thirty-day readmission rate was 16%. The median LOS, including patients in observation status and labor and delivery patients, was 2.94 days (range 0-628, [1.67 , 5.34]). The median LOS excluding patients in observation status was 3.44 days (range 0-628, [2.08 , 6.12]). The median LOS excluding patients in observation status and labor and delivery patients, was 3.71 days (range 0-628, [2.15 , 6.51]). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient cohort are summarized in Table 1. Higher rates of 30-day readmissions were observed in patients who were older (median age 62 vs. 59 years), African American (rate of 17% vs. 13% in whites), divorced/separated or widowed (rates of 17% vs. rates of 13% for married/partnered or single patients), on Medicare insurance (rate of 17% vs. 10% for private insurance), and had one or multiple chronic conditions such as cancer, renal disease, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc. (\hyperref[table:table1]{Table 1}).
